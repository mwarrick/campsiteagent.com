# Multi-Park Support Deployment Guide

## Summary
Added support for multiple parks with facility-level filtering. You can now monitor multiple CA state parks, and for parks like Crystal Cove, you can specify which facilities (campgrounds) to monitor.

## New Features
1. **Multiple Active Parks** - Monitor as many parks as you want
2. **Facility Filtering** - Restrict scraping to specific campgrounds within a park (e.g., only Moro Campground at Crystal Cove)
3. **User-Selected Parks** - Added your requested parks:
   - San Clemente State Beach (707)
   - Chino Hills State Park (627)
   - Crystal Cove State Park (635) - **Only Facility #447 (Moro Campground)**

## Files Changed

### Database Migration
- `app/migrations/013_add_user_selected_parks.sql` - Adds facility_filter column and your 3 parks

### Backend Changes
- `app/src/Services/ReserveCaliforniaScraper.php` - Added facility filtering support
- `app/src/Services/ScraperService.php` - Passes facility filters to scraper
- `app/src/Services/MetadataSyncService.php` - Respects facility filters during sync

### Discovery/Testing Scripts
- `app/bin/discover-parks.php` - Discover all available CA state parks from API
- `app/bin/test-new-park.php` - Test scraping for newly added parks

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Files to Server
```bash
# From your local machine
cd /Users/markwarrick/Projects/CA-State-Park-Campsite-Monitor/CA-State-Park-Campsite-Monitor

# Copy files to server
scp campsiteagent/app/migrations/013_add_user_selected_parks.sql root@mark-MacPro.local:/var/www/campsite-agent/app/migrations/
scp campsiteagent/app/src/Services/ReserveCaliforniaScraper.php root@mark-MacPro.local:/var/www/campsite-agent/app/src/Services/
scp campsiteagent/app/src/Services/ScraperService.php root@mark-MacPro.local:/var/www/campsite-agent/app/src/Services/
scp campsiteagent/app/src/Services/MetadataSyncService.php root@mark-MacPro.local:/var/www/campsite-agent/app/src/Services/
scp campsiteagent/app/bin/test-new-park.php root@mark-MacPro.local:/var/www/campsite-agent/app/bin/
scp campsiteagent/app/bin/discover-parks.php root@mark-MacPro.local:/var/www/campsite-agent/app/bin/

# Set permissions
ssh root@mark-MacPro.local "chmod +x /var/www/campsite-agent/app/bin/*.php && chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/campsite-agent/app"
```

### 2. Run Database Migration
```bash
ssh root@mark-MacPro.local
cd /var/www/campsite-agent

# Run migration
mysql -u campsitechecker -p campsitechecker < app/migrations/013_add_user_selected_parks.sql

# Verify parks were added
mysql -u campsitechecker -p campsitechecker -e "SELECT id, name, park_number, active, facility_filter FROM parks ORDER BY name;"
```

Expected output:
```
+----+-------------------+--------------+--------+-----------------+
| id | name              | park_number  | active | facility_filter |
+----+-------------------+--------------+--------+-----------------+
|  1 | San Onofre SB     | 712          |      1 | NULL            |
|  2 | San Clemente SB   | 707          |      1 | NULL            |
|  3 | Chino Hills SP    | 627          |      1 | NULL            |
|  4 | Crystal Cove SP   | 635          |      1 | ["447"]         |
+----+-------------------+--------------+--------+-----------------+
```

### 3. Test One of the New Parks (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
cd /var/www/campsite-agent/app
php bin/test-new-park.php

# Select option 1, 2, or 3 to test
# This will verify the park has facilities and can be scraped
```

### 4. Sync Metadata for New Parks
```bash
cd /var/www/campsite-agent/app
php bin/sync-metadata.php
```

This will fetch all facilities and sites for the new parks without doing a full availability scrape.

### 5. Verify in Dashboard
1. Go to http://campsiteagent.com
2. Click the **Park** dropdown
3. You should now see **4 parks**:
   - San Onofre SB
   - San Clemente SB
   - Chino Hills SP
   - Crystal Cove SP

### 6. Test Manual Scrape
1. In the dashboard, select one of the new parks
2. Click **Check Now**
3. Watch the progress - it should scrape only that park
4. For Crystal Cove, it should only scrape **Moro Campground (Facility 447)**

## How Facility Filtering Works

### Parks WITHOUT Filter
- **San Onofre**, **San Clemente**, **Chino Hills**: `facility_filter = NULL`
- Scrapes **all campgrounds** at these parks

### Parks WITH Filter
- **Crystal Cove**: `facility_filter = ["447"]`
- Only scrapes **Moro Campground** (facility 447)
- Ignores all other campgrounds at Crystal Cove

## Adding More Parks Later

### To add a new park (all facilities):
```sql
INSERT INTO parks (name, external_id, park_number, active) 
VALUES ('Park Name', 'park_slug', '123', 1);
```

### To add a park with facility filter:
```sql
INSERT INTO parks (name, external_id, park_number, active, facility_filter) 
VALUES ('Park Name', 'park_slug', '123', 1, '["facility_id_1", "facility_id_2"]');
```

### To discover more parks:
```bash
cd /var/www/campsite-agent/app
php bin/discover-parks.php
```

This will show all CA state parks available in the ReserveCalifornia API.

## Troubleshooting

### Park not showing in dropdown?
```sql
-- Check if park is active
SELECT name, active FROM parks WHERE park_number = '707';

-- Activate it
UPDATE parks SET active = 1 WHERE park_number = '707';
```

### Want to test only a specific facility?
```sql
-- Set facility filter
UPDATE parks 
SET facility_filter = '["facility_id"]' 
WHERE park_number = '635';

-- Remove facility filter (scrape all)
UPDATE parks 
SET facility_filter = NULL 
WHERE park_number = '635';
```

### Check what facilities a park has:
```bash
cd /var/www/campsite-agent/app
mysql -u campsitechecker -p campsitechecker -e "
SELECT f.id, f.name, f.external_id 
FROM facilities f 
JOIN parks p ON f.park_id = p.id 
WHERE p.park_number = '635';
"
```

## Architecture Notes

- **Database**: `parks.facility_filter` column stores JSON array of allowed facility IDs
- **Scraper**: `ReserveCaliforniaScraper::fetchParkFacilities()` filters facilities if provided
- **Service Layer**: `ScraperService` and `MetadataSyncService` read facility_filter and pass to scraper
- **UI**: No changes needed - automatically picks up new active parks

## Next Steps

After deployment:
1. âœ… Run "Check Now" for each new park to verify scraping works
2. âœ… Set up scheduled scraping via cron (separate task)
3. âœ… Monitor logs for any errors
4. ðŸ“§ Users with alert preferences will automatically receive notifications for all active parks (unless they've specified a specific park in their preferences)

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Apache error log: `tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log`
2. Check application logs (if you've set them up)
3. Test individual park scraping: `php bin/test-new-park.php`
4. Verify database: Check `parks`, `facilities`, and `sites` tables
